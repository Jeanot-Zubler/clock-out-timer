# clock-out timer

This simple script takes the .rtf-export from TimeAs (our company time keeping program) and calculates the time when I can clock out.

It also checks, whether the legally required breaks have been taken. (30 minutes for work time above 7h, 1h for work times above 9h).

It takes no command line arguments. This might be implemented later.

Feel free to use and adapt this code.
